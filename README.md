# wheatstone-bridge
3rd until 8th semester with breaks 

module for an internally created platform used to measure resistances for weight and temprature measurements

two micro controllers used in a multiple masters system
1. connected to the I2C bus communicating with th bus and with the other microcontroller
2. taking measurements from 6 input ports and coordinating resistance ranges and setting bridge voltage to zero
